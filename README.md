In the currently existing techniques, the fine structure of the image is not preserved hence it has a higher perceptual fog density. This problem is need to be addressed to overcome the fine structure issue and reduce the parameter of perceptual fog density. The currently existing techniques which have failed to implement such are globally guided image filtering and weighted guided image filtering techniques. These techniques largely depend upon the equation base rather than the level of haze present in the images.![image](https://github.com/hiteshgupta21/Image_Correction/assets/116364420/c4c764cb-9ea5-4806-9cf0-91992d9b1867)
